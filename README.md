Assignment: 
For this assignment: Choose a country and two different disruptive technologies. 
Using the national systems of innovation approach, select two institutions from your chosen country and analyse how each of those institutions shaped the development and diffusion of your two chosen disruptive technologies. Provide suggestions on how the institutions you have chosen could better support/constrain the development of the two disruptive technologies of your choice. Illustrate your answer with relevant and up-to-date examples. 
In   your   essay, you   can   argue   in   favour   of   the   development   of   one   or   both   of   your   chosen technologies   if   you   think   that   these   technologies   play   a   positive   societal   role, or you   may argue   that   one   or   both   of   your   chosen   technologies   should   be   constrained   if   you   think   that   the disruptive   technologies   of   your   choice   do   not   play   a   positive   societal   role.
Choosing the two technologies for the Assignment 
•         When choosing disruptive technologies, you must select two technologies from two different lectures ((1) biotechnology, (2) one   of   the   three   renewable   energies   - wind,   solar, or e-vehicles, and (3) AI, or the   sharing   economy). You must   not   compare technologies that were discussed in the same lecture (e.g., wind vs.   solar   energy).
Using Theories in the Assignment 
•         For this assignment, you must refer to and apply the theories and academic 
literature discussed in the module (e.g. the national systems   of   innovation   (NSI)   literature). For a higher mark you can also use relevant academic   articles   not discussed in lectures or included in the Resource   List.
•         Make sure that you identify the specific NSI approach you want to use in your
analysis, that you explain the theory and that you justify your choice of theory.
You should also evaluate the theories you   are using   (e.g. what   are the   strengths   and weaknesses   of   theNSI   approach   you   have 代 写38170 Disruptive Innovation and International Business 2024Matlab

A specific   NSI   approach   maybe   good   at   explaining   the   development   of   one   of   the technologies   you   are   using   but   not   another, etc). 
Providing Recommendation in the Assignment 
•         When   providing   suggestion   for   change   of   the   institutions   you   have   chosen, you   can
discuss whether the country of   your choice should support or   constrain/limit   (for example   if   you   think   there   are   more   societal   benefits   to   limiting   the   development   of   a technology) the   development   of   the   disruptive   technologies   you   are   discussing. Make sure   you   explain   and   justify   your   decisions. 
Use up to date empirical evidence in the Assignment 
•         For any analysis included in the assignment, use up-to-date empirical   evidence   (e.g.,   statistics, company examples, country examples, newspaper articles, media reports, industry   reports, etc.).
Marking Criteria 
•         Please have a look at the marking criteria below. As you can   see marks   are   awarded   according to a number of   criteria including: The clarity and   focus with   which   you address the assessment task (for a good mark you must answer the   essay   question   and   be   as   focused   as   possible); the   logical   structure   of   your   argument;   evidence   of knowledge   of   course   material   including   the   clarity   of   the   explanation   of   key theoretical ideas and key concepts; the relevance and quality of   the   examples   you   use to illustrate your arguments; your independent and critical thinking.
